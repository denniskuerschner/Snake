Welcome sir Cicil!

As you can see I've been trying to go on developing the game snake. 

While I was trying to use the variable 'username' from 'welcome.html' for other html files I could'nt.

So I was wondering how I can use the user Input 'username' for other html files. Escpecially later when I wanna do a highscore list. 

Looking forward for your answer :)
